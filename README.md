# FoodWebProject

This project was conducted as part of a NSF and a USDA research grant from 2009 through 2011 on the islands of Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. 

We are using the project as an example for the EEB590 class at Iowa State University, to demonstrate how to organize folders and go through the whole data cycle.
